# IOT based smart mirror using raspberry pi 3

This project was done in my final year of computer engineering. 

Smart mirror is a device which shows you various information on the go like news, weather, calendar, reminders etc. On the mirror. The smart mirror can be used in homes, schools, hospitals, malls and so on. The smart mirror, I have made has the ability to control electrical appliances like lights and fans using voice commands and through a web portal. The intention of this project was for personal use.
